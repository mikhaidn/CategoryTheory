## 📚 Resources

See [resources.md](./resources.md) for curated learning materials tailored to your background.

## 🎯 Projects

Hands-on projects to solidify understanding - see [projects/README.md](./projects/README.md) for detailed project ideas and guidelines:

- [ ] Statistical inference project (A/B testing framework)
- [ ] Classical ML project (end-to-end supervised learning pipeline)
- [ ] Deep learning project (image or NLP task)
- [ ] LLM application (RAG system or fine-tuning)
- [ ] MLOps project (deploy and monitor a production model)

Each project should leverage your SWE skills with proper testing, documentation, and production-quality code.
